"Ren√© Navarre, Edmund Breon, Georges Melchior",1 nomination,N/A,France,N/A,Louis Feuillade,"Crime, Drama",6.9/10,"None, French",,N/A,"Naturally, after his last experience, Inspector Juve winces under such rebuff as the substitution of Valgrand and the escape of Fantomas. Eventually a mysterious crime puzzles him and his assistant, Fandor. To the chief of the Criminal Investigation Department, he reports that the body of a woman, found in the house of Dr. Charles, cannot be identified. Papers bearing the name of Lady Beltham had been discovered in her clothing. Was the body that of Lady Beltham, the accomplice of Gurn, or was it the intention that people should believe that she was dead? Juve wondered why the body was found in the house of Dr. Charles. He concerns himself to watch the house, and the patience of Fandor and himself is unexpectedly rewarded. One day Dr. Charles leaves the house, and the car in which he rides is followed. Charles makes a false move. The man who leaves the closed car is not the Dr. Charles who got in. He is now a young man, with a black moustache, whereas Charles is a middle-aged man with a black beard. That is decidedly suspicions, and the detectives are in time to see him accept a note from a woman who is waiting for him. Instructing Fandor to follow the girl, Juve goes after the other man, known to the police as Lawrence, the leader of bandits. Following Lawrence (alias Charles) in a taxi, he is fated to lose his quarry, as an accomplice of the bandit punctures the tire of one of the wheels, and Juve is stranded in a street while Lawrence gets clear away. So far there is nothing to connect Charles, alias Lawrence, with Fantomas, alias Gurn. Fandor fares much better. The girl does not succeed in throwing the younger detective off the track and is apparently unconscious of the fact that she is being followed until she notices Fandor in the same compartment of the railway carriage in which she is traveling. Fandor tracks her to a house. Having seen her safely indoors, he sends a note to Juve, saying that he is keeping a good watch. Meanwhile, Lawrence has rend the note Josephine handed him, and he learns that an elderly man, confidential clerk in the employment of Messrs, Brown and Co., has fallen in love with her. That afternoon he is taking $30,000 to clients of the firm, and thinking that she is attached to him, wishes to take her with him on the journey. They were leaving the Gare de Lyon Station for Bercy by the Northern Express at three o'clock that afternoon. Would Lawrence be at the station with others of the gang? In consequence of the breakdown of the car, the note which Fandor had written did not reach Juve. Fandor, however, had waited near the house of the girl, and when she left, dressed as a lady, followed her to the Gare de Lyon, where she met the confidential messenger. No doubt there was a hidden meaning in this meeting, and Fandor decided to join the train; so did Lawrence and others of the gang whom he had gathered round him. The whole party traveled in the last coach of the train, and when the time bad arrived, one of the men climbed along the footboard and uncoupled the coach. Lawrence recognized Fandor, but his presence on the train made no difference to the plans of the bandits. As the coach began to fall away from the rest of the train, Josephine left the compartment in which a peremptory demand for the money be carried, whilst Fandor was also attacked. By this time the speed of the coach has very sensibly slackened and the gang easily escaped, fleeing in a motorcar waiting for them. In the car they examined the haul, and to their intense mortification discovered that the notes the man carried were all half notes, the remainder of which were to be handed to the clients of Brown and Co. when the contract was completed. When Fandor recovered from the shock of the attack he pulled the communication cord. To his consternation he found that not only had it been severed, but that the coach was running down the decline. He knew that the Northern Express was following the train in which he had traveled, and nothing but a miracle would avert a serious disaster. The coach ran back, and as the express began to cross the bridge the engine collided with the coach and the whole train was terribly wrecked. Lawrence determines to obtain the remaining halves of the notes, but decides that before doing so Juve must be killed. With that purpose in view, he, in the name of Fandor, wires to Juve to come to the Bercy cellars of Brown and Co. the following night. Juve, taking the wire as authentic, goes to Bercy, and. seeing someone moving behind the casks, fires, and then creeps forward, to run against Fandor. Lawrence and his accomplice began firing at the detectives, the barrels of spirit were set on fire, and through a tornado of flames the detectives escape. Fantomas again himself escapes, and they lose entire trace of him until one night when at a hotel, Juve and Fandor meet Josephine, and after Juve is introduced by Fandor, he insists that Josephine divulge the whereabouts of Fantomas. She reluctantly, under the threat of arrest, takes Juve to a place where Fantomas is dining with two wealthy young ladies in the disguise of the supposed Dr. Charles. A card is sent to Fantomas saying that someone is waiting for him outside. Fantomas, believing this to be one of his gang, departs from the hotel and is immediately arrested by Juve and Fandor. After they walk down the street, Dr. Charles suddenly makes a struggle and to the amazement of Juve and Fandor, he leaves in their hands nothing but two plaster casts of his arms with his coat sleeves attached. They decide to track Lady Beltham. After much trouble they discover her to be making midnight visits to her old haunted villa. Here they make a visit in the day-time, and being satisfied that there must be still some connection between Fantomas and Lady Beltham, hide and overhear a conversation where Faniomas decides be must get rid of Juve and will send a silent executioner to destroy him. Juve does not exactly know what this silent executioner means, but he prepares to receive a serpent. He is almost crushed to death in spite of his precaution, but survives and surrounds the haunted villa of Lady Beltham. Fantomas is almost caught unprepared, but being ever ready, he quickly sets a trap in which to get together the whole of the police, including Juve and Fandor, so that he may destroy them all by dynamite. These easily fall into the trap, so quickly but well laid. Fantomas realizes that his opportunity has come, and leaping from a cistern in which he had been hiding, he touches the coil of wire and explodes the dynamite cartridge, blowing the haunted villa to a heap of ruins, together with the occupants. The question still remains unsolved: Are Juve and Fandor still alive?",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTFkM2M4MTAtMTE2NC00MjZlLThlZDctMWU3YTIwY2ViMzU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDI3OTIzOA@@._V1_SX300.jpg,N/A,Not Rated,01 Nov 1913,True,100%,61 min,Fantomas: The Man in Black,movie,N/A,"Marcel Allain, Louis Feuillade, Pierre Souvestre",1913,tt0003037,6.9,"1,676",

Hildy divorced Walter largely because she wanted more of a home life, whereas Walter saw her more as a driven hard-boiled reporter than subservient homemaker.

The appointment is despite the reservations of the Reverend Mother who believes Sister Clodagh not ready for such an assignment, especially because of its isolated location. The convent will be a new one located in the mountainside Palace of Mopu in the Himalayas, and is only possible through the donation by General Todo Rai of Mopu - ""The Old General"" - of the palace, where the Old General's father formerly kept his concubine. On the Old General's directive, the convent is to provide schooling to the children and young women, and general dispensary services to all native residents who live in the valley below the palace. Accompanying Sister Clodagh will be four of the other nuns, each chosen for a specific reason: Sister Briony for her strength, Sister Phillipa who is to tend to the garden for food, Sister Blanche - more commonly referred to as Sister Honey - for her general ability to spread happiness, and troubled Sister Ruth, who the Reverend Mother believes will truly find her faith from the change in locale. The palace comes with an elderly female caretaker, slightly off kilter Angu Ayah, and a holy man who meditates in solitude and silence outside the palace grounds night and day, he who is not to be disturbed. The General also provides a young boy, six year old Joseph Anthony, the General's cook's son, who will live at the convent to provide translation services. But the sisters' primary liaison to the General and the outside world is his agent, native Brit Mr. Dean, which may prove to be problematic in his gender and doing any work around the convent. Sister Clodagh faces early challenges in feeling the need to accept two people to the convent: seventeen year old Kanchi, who is pushing the boundaries of her sexuality; and the Old General's son, the ""Young General"", who wants the same educational opportunities, if not better, than that offered to his female counterparts. Beyond these issues, each of the sisters is challenged by this posting, from the cultural differences, to the isolation, to the general openness of their environment. Sister Clodagh, as the leader, feels that she has no one to turn to in her confusion, her thoughts turning back to her time in Ireland before joining the order and her love for a young man named Con that was partly the reason for her decision to devote her life to God. But it is Sister Ruth whose issues may be the most problematic as she is becoming unhinged in her growing romantic obsession with Mr. Dean, especially as jealousy emerges in she also believing that Sister Clodagh is falling in love with him as well, which may or may not be the case.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjRmMTQyNDEtNWM4Zi00ZTMwLTlkOGUtZTdmZDU0NTNiZTQ0XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg,N/A,Approved,01 Dec 1947,True,100%,101 min,Black Narcissus,movie,N/A,"Rumer Godden, Michael Powell, Emeric Pressburger",1947,tt0039192,7.7,"29,056",

After one of their rockets carrying wasps malfunctions and goes off course, a computer calculates that the rocket is likely to land somewhere off the coast of Africa. Some time later, in a remote part of Africa, Dr. Lorentz and his daughter Lorna perform an autopsy on a native and determine that he died of paralysis of the nerve centers caused by an injection of a massive amount of venom. Arobi, Lorentz' African assistant, then informs him that a monster is believed to be terrorizing people and animals in an area known as Green Hell. Several months later, Brady reads a newspaper account of turmoil in Central Africa caused by gigantic monsters and surmises that the wasps in the missing rocket were exposed to huge amounts of cosmic radiation because an earlier, very minimal overexposure had resulted in the birth of a spider crab twice the size of its mother. Brady and Morgan request a leave of absence from Washington and head for Africa to investigate. In Libreville, equatorial Africa, the territorial agent makes plans for them to travel to meet Dr. Lorentz. Once the safari is ready, Mahri, an Arab, leads Brady and Morgan on the four-hundred mile trek to Lorentz' hospital. The safari battles brush fires, fever, drought and storms, eventually reaching the Lorentz compound where Lorna informs them that her father has not returned from a journey to Green Hell. Later, Arobi arrives with the news that Lorentz has been killed by a monster living in the cauldron of a volcano and gives Brady a giant stinger he removed from the doctor's shoulder. After Brady analyzes the stinger, he confirms that it belongs to a giant, deadly wasp. Although Brady advises Lorna to stay at the hospital, she insists on accompanying him, Morgan, Mahri and Arobi to Green Hell. When the native bearers learn of the destination, they desert, and although Lorna is able to shame several local villagers into helping, they, too, run off when the group comes upon a deserted native village littered with dead bodies. After Brady expresses his concern that the insects may be multiplying rapidly and could eventually overrun all of Africa, he states that they must destroy the queen and her immediate colony. Brady then explains to Mahri that he has brought small, grenade-like bombs, filled with a special explosive, to use against the monsters. As they move closer to the base of the volcano, which shows signs of an imminent eruption, they hear a very loud, buzzing sound. When Brady looks down from a ridge above the volcano, he finds the queen and several gigantic wasps. The four men toss grenades into the bowl, but the explosions only serve to anger the wasps. Lorna and the men are pursued by one of the wasps, the size of a large building, but hide in a cave that it cannot enter. The group escapes through another entrance, and, just as they emerge, the volcano erupts, spewing massive lava flows that destroy all the wasps in the conflagration. Morgan then notes that nature has a way of destroying its mistakes.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDIzYjU3ZTEtODRiMC00OTQ2LWI5NmYtMjQwM2U3N2I3YTkzXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg,N/A,Approved,17 May 1957,True,,71 min,Monster from Green Hell,movie,N/A,"Louis Vittes, Endre Bohem",1957,tt0050723,3.7,"1,413",

While the rest of the animation industry was nearing its trough, with no money to spend and the only source of income ill-paying TV, this one has all of its technical issues sorted away: full animation, very good backgrounding and an engaging jazz score. With all this, what are we offered? A story for small children in which we are told to be content with what we are, because that is what we are meant to be.It reminds me of something Joseph Barbera said in the late 1970s, that he yearned for a return to animation in which ""when a cat chases a mouse, he doesn't have to stop and teach him how to blow glass or weave a basket. My wish for Christmas is that they would leave education to the schools and entertainment to us."" The United States was in the middle of a struggle for civil rights for Blacks, and here the lesson offered to small children was to be content with one's lot in life.

It's a simple plan, but there's one big problem: Unbeknownst to Sherry, Big Momma has unexpectedly left town. So Malcolm, decides to impersonate the cantankerous Southern granny. Using a few tricks of disguise, he completely transforms himself into Big Momma, even taking on the corpulent septuagenarian's everyday routine-from cooking soul food to delivering babies to ""testifying"" at the local church. In the mean time, Malcolm starts falling for Sherry, who may or may not be hiding some stolen cash. Now, Malcolm/Big Momma must somehow find a way to nab his criminal and the girl.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg4YWY4MjEtNzQ2NC00MDJjLTg3YWEtZDI1ODkzYjEwNjczXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg,N/A,PG-13,02 Jun 2000,True,30%,99 min,Big Momma's House,movie,N/A,"Darryl Quarles, Don Rhymer",2000,tt0208003,5.2,"92,695",

In the intervening years, ostentatious houses have sprung up around him. He's been at the same architectural firm for twenty years in a job he hates, which primarily consists of building scale models. On the day that he is fired from his job, he is diagnosed with an advanced case of terminal cancer, which he chooses not to disclose to his family.

Sharon is afraid that Fred will be killed by gambler Joe Sapphire, to whom he has amassed a large debt. Sharon also confides that she is in love with her husband's business partner, Stephen Mason, and that she wants to keep her husband alive so that Stephen will not be suspected if Fred is murdered by Sapphire. When Jerry asks Sapphire to call off his hit on Fred, Sapphire tells Jerry that Fred has paid him in full, and that the money was the exact amount reported stolen from the Tiger Club's safe a week earlier. A short time later, Sharon and Stephen find the dead body of her husband, along with a suicide note instructing Sharon to collect Fred's life insurance money. While Sharon unthinkingly touches a gun on Fred's desk, Stephen burns the note so that the suicide clause on Fred's insurance will not invalidate Sharon's claim. Suspicion soon falls on Sapphire, who later accuses Jerry of setting him up.

Daniel's (Liam Neeson's) wife has just died, leaving him to take care of his adolescent stepson Sam (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) by himself. Daniel is uncertain how to deal with Sam and his problems without his wife present, especially in light of a potential budding romance within their household. Juliet (Keira Knightley) and Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor) have just gotten married. They believe that Peter's best friend and best man Mark (Andrew Lincoln) hates Juliet, but won't say so to his or her face. Others looking at the situation from the outside believe Mark is jealous of Juliet, as he is in love with Peter. Jamie (Colin Firth), a writer, is taking a writing retreat by himself in rural France following catching his latest girlfriend (Sienna Guillory) in an indiscretion. Jamie ends up spending much time in France with Aurelia (L√∫cia Moniz), the Portuguese woman hired as the housekeeper. The question becomes not only if they can communicate their day-to-day needs with each other as she speaks no English, he speaks no Portuguese, and neither speaks French very well, but communicate what seems to be their increasing mutual attraction to each other. Sarah (Laura Linney) has been in love with her co-worker Karl (Rodrigo Santoro) for the two years they have worked together, this attraction about which everyone in their workplace knows. Sarah has to decide if she can be forward enough to express this love directly to Karl, especially in light of what has been her personal priority of dealing with a family issue. Harry (Alan Rickman) and Karen (Dame Emma Thompson) have been in a stable long term marriage. His new assistant Mia (Heike Makatsch) drops hints to him that she would like them to be romantically involved.

At 10 Downing Street, he is attracted to one of the new household servants, Natalie (Martine McCutcheon), but isn't sure what to do about it seeing as to their respective positions, the probable public scrutiny, and an incident involving the visiting U.S. President (Billy Bob Thornton). Socially unaware Colin Frissell (Kris Marshall) believes that the lack of romantic love in his life is all the fault of standoffish British women. As such, he decides to take decisive albeit somewhat unusual geographic action. And John (Martin Freeman) and Judy (Joanna Page) are movie body doubles.

One is her father abandoning the family when she was young, leading to her and her mother turning to the music of Carly Simon to cope, and she having had a history of unsatisfying romantic relationships in not having a suitable male role model. The other is her idolization of Diane Sawyer, who she has long wanted to work alongside as a serious journalist. Her personal life seems to have finally overcome the issue of her father with the entrance of Derek into her life, he, a scout for the New Jersey Devils, her boyfriend who she knew was her soul mate when they met, they now living together. Things are not going as well on the professional front, she having just left a dead end job to work among the large stable of associate producers on the syndicated Trenton-based daytime talk show ""Kippie Kann Do!!"", whose show topics are outrageous, the more outrageous the better. Stacy's tenure with the show is even more tenuous as Kippie herself has been the fodder for the tabloids, Stacy further learning that someone on staff has been feeding the tabloids those stories in trying to push Kippie out with cause as there is five years left in her contract. When Stacy learns that Derek once dated supermodel Lulu Fritz, who has appeared on the talk show circuit, including on Kippie's show, in discussing her bulimia, Stacy begins to wonder what else about his dating past Derek has failed to mention. This item comes to a head when Stacy has access to Derek's palm pilot to discover that he has been in recent contact with at least two former girlfriends, both equally as successful as Lulu, and neither which Derek had ever mentioned let alone about this recent contact. In general discussion with her work colleagues in a show idea of snooping in a significant other's little black book to discover what secret life that person may be leading, Stacy, with her two confidantes among those colleagues, Barb Campbell-Dunn and Ira Nachlis, by her side, goes about delving further into Derek's proverbial little back book - his palm pilot - by contacting those former girlfriends under an assumed name to find out more information about their relationship with Derek under the guise of possible appearances on Kippie's show about their work lives.

Tracing the origins of his remarkably unique sensibility, the film journeys back to Bickford's childhood in a competitive household during the paranoia of the Cold War and examines his relationship with his father, George, who is facing the onset of Alzheimer's Disease. Bickford's films, especially the dark and magical clay animations he created for Frank Zappa in the 1970s, have achieved cult status worldwide. Entirely self-taught, the 56-year-old Bickford works alone in a makeshift basement studio in his house near Seattle. Bickford's father George, a retired Boeing engineer of the Cold War era, is the other main character. George's talent for maximizing the space inside airplanes and missiles parallels his son's animations, which often contain dozens of inch-tall figures fighting battles on a tiny set. George's wondrous musings about the universe reveal a deep admiration for the implicit architect of such splendor while atheism prevents him from admitting the possibility of a God. Along with the wonder of creation, George considers the pain of a life spent disengaged from his family and centered on the imperfections in those around him.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1MTI1NDk2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTkxMDA2MDE@._V1_SX300.jpg,N/A,Not Rated,01 Feb 2020,True,86%,80 min,Monster Road,movie,N/A,N/A,2004,tt0397538,7.7,212,

Although she didn't see it as being perfect, she probably would have stuck it out as what she saw as the ""for better or worse"" obligation of the wedding vows, that is if her ex-husband, Kevin, didn't end it for what ended up being leaving her for a younger woman. She is urged by her over-supportive family, comprised of her many siblings, their partners, and her widowed father, to get back into the dating scene, something she has been reluctant to do in not feeling ready. As such, her most proactive sister in the matter, Carol (Elizabeth Perkins), sets her up on an Internet dating site. Within her less than prepared state, Sarah does go along with meeting men by the means offered to her. Beyond especially her female siblings, Sarah is given unique perspectives on the whole issue of dating and commitment by her father, Bill (Christopher Plummer), who is exploring dating after losing who was the love of his life in Sarah's mother, thrice divorced Dolly (Stockard Channing), one of Bill's conquests, who he meets on-line, and Sarah's gay teaching colleague, Leo (Brad William Henke), who she sees as being in the most committed loving relationship with his partner Eric (Victor Webster) of anyone she knows. Of the men she meets, Sarah makes what she believes is a connection with two, albeit awkward in both cases. One is Bob Connor (Dermot Mulroney), the divorced father of one of her students, her hesitance in dating him only because of crossing the professional/personal line. The other is custom wooden boat builder Jake Anderson (John Cusack), who too was pushed into trying on-line dating by his best friend/divorce lawyer Charlie (Ben Shenkman), who wants Jake solely to get some action despite Jake wanting his love life to be more like Lara and Yuri in Doctor Zhivago (1965). Much of what happens between Sarah and the two men is based on what stage they are in post-divorce dating life, but is also dependent on how much Sarah is willing to take a chance on each, which may also include her and the respective man just not meshing at a given point in time, and her making a wrong decision in the process based on what she sees as the prospects.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGFlYTA5YjgtNDM5OC00NTlhLWFlNjMtMDY2YWJhYWQ2YTg2XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg,N/A,PG-13,29 Jul 2005,True,37%,98 min,Must Love Dogs,movie,N/A,"Claire Cook, Gary David Goldberg",2005,tt0417001,5.9,"33,364",

Self-proclaimed ""film noir"", the black &amp; white film centers around a small rubber frog named Tiger. Tiger, who does not speak (or move much, being rubber), becomes a major singing star -- an overnight success. Nobody apparently notices (or cares) that he can only sing one song. Eventually, Tiger has to cope with the trappings of stardom (ego, drinking, debauchery, etc.) and forgets the people who got him to where he was in life.This is not truly film noir, rather a mild comedy that falls flat. The high point? The song that Tiger sings repeatedly in the short run time. Once you see the film, you'll never really forget it. For that reason alone, force someone to watch this with you.

The passion and pathos of legendary poet Dylan Thomas is told through the lives of two extraordinary women. Vera Phillips and Dylan were teenage loves; fast forward ten years and the two reconnect in London. She's working as a singer whilst he's churning out scripts for government propaganda films and living off the last in a long line of infatuated women. The two former lovers feel the thunderbolt once more, but Thomas is now married to the adventurous Caitlin. Despite their love-rival status, the women form a surprising friendship. Caitlin indulges in her own infidelities, and recognises a similar adventurous spirit in her husband. But she knows his connection with Vera is something different, not to mention dangerous. Romantic turmoil continues in Vera's life. She marries her devoted admirer William Killick, but she can't deny the chemistry between herself and Dylan, nor does she want to - even if this means betraying Caitlin. When William is posted abroad, and a pregnant Vera returns to Wales with her married friends, the battle between her heart and head becomes more intense. William returns a changed man, but neither is Vera the carefree cabaret girl he married. Neighbourhood gossip fuels her husband's jealousy towards his rival. Enraged, William stages a violent attack on Dylan - an attack that forces Vera to choose between the men in her life and the friend that she loves.

He is a cowboy as raw as his hides. The year is 1925. The Burbank brothers are wealthy ranchers in Montana. At the Red Mill restaurant on their way to market, the brothers meet Rose, the widowed proprietress, and her impressionable son Peter.

As Phil swings between fury and cunning, his taunting of Rose takes an eerie form - he hovers at the edges of her vision, whistling a tune she can no longer play. His mockery of her son is more overt, amplified by the cheering of Phil's cowhand disciples. Then Phil appears to take the boy under his wing.

He is dazed from sleep deprivation and spinning out a little from his coffee high, necking Pro Plus and washing it down with his 5th cup. The room is atmospherically lit with the sodium glow of florescent lighting and we get a real sense of repetition, monotony and a man who is completely bored with his job - on the edge of quitting but with nowhere else to go. Without warning the copier begins to shake and make strange noises, the scanner flashes repeating over and over, but nothing is coming out of the printer. Charlie is clearly annoyed, hitting the machine and punching buttons. The copier suddenly goes silent and still - Charlie throws his hands up in frustration. Out of desperation he kicks the copier and it spits out one A3 print of a large round black spot centred on the page. As he moves the paper his coffee cup falls into this black hole. Slowly he edges towards the copier - a low angle shot from the POV of the hole sees him step into frame. He peers over into the hole wondering where his coffee cup has gone. Inquisitively he rolls up his shirtsleeve and gingerly moves his hand towards the hole - his fingers twitch as they near the black ink. Unbelievably Charlie's hand sinks straight into the printed page just like it was an Acme toy hole from a cartoon. He puts his arm further and further in until its right up to the elbow, fishing around for his coffee cup. The copier jerks to a halt - Charlie pulls his arm out with a sudden movement, slightly freaked out. The cup is in his hand - he clicks it a few times staring mystified at the hole. We now watch as Charlie discovers what other fun he can have with the hole. He sticks the piece of paper up on the vending machine and pulls out a bar of chocolate to eat. Charlie begins to think.

Wealthy people everywhere live in fear. To protect himself from this scourge - Chang, son of a Shopping Mall owner, employs two female Martial Arts experts to protect himself and his family.That is the set-up! The film itself is something quite different though. Most of the running time is spent on the relationship between Chang and his shopaholic (though good-hearted) wife Anna. Chang's slavish devotion to his fathers business has put a serious strain on their marriage. He could really need a break. Meanwhile, the newfound boyfriend of Chang's secretary possesses a startling resemblance to the Shopping-Mall heir himself...Cynthia Khan and Yukari √îshima play the bodyguard-duo Butterfly and Rose. Despite receiving top-billing, their collective screen-time is less than 10 minutes. What's more, their scenes are almost completely divorced from the main narrative itself. They handle the action, while the rest of the cast have to deal with the comedy and drama. This is all-in-all a rather unremarkable, mediocre film. The storyline and action is serviceable enough to watch. Nothing about it is overtly bad, just uninspired, and the disconnect between the action scenes and the rest of the narrative is palpable to be sure.

The process of Masha becoming part of the Diaz family is going to change both girls forever. THE DARK MATTER OF LOVE follows Masha as she leaves Russia to spend her first year as part of the Diaz family, who have also adopted five year old twin boys Marcel and Vadim. When the reality of bonding with children who have grown up in institutions turns out to be more difficult than they ever imagined, the Diaz's hire two of the world's best developmental psychologists to help them build their new family - through science. Professor Emeritus at the University of Virginia School of Medicine, Dr Robert Marvin, has spent a lifetime developing a world-renowned therapy program that draws upon the past 100 years of scientific discoveries in the field of parent child love. By connecting the Diaz's with his research, Dr Marvin believes that he can help them create an environment in which Masha, Marcel and Vadim can form supportive, loving relationships. Sometimes hilarious, sometimes heartbreaking, THE DARK MATTER OF LOVE melds the story of the Diaz family learning to love, with rare archive footage of science experiments exploring parent child love.

The film explores the reasons why so many black men have concerns of unfair treatment, especially while driving. We get to see the psychology behind Dimitri's attitude towards the police, through piercing flashbacks to his prior experiences with the cops - from childhood to present day, the cops have always had their eye on him. The script was written with technical advice from the Sheriffs Department in order to create something totally authentic, showing the real deal about police attitudes towards DRIVING WHILE BLACK and ""race out of place"". The film will be shot with the realism of a documentary. The use of original artwork, Instagram and other digital graphics will give the film a modern, and unique feel. We will follow Dimitri on his path to his dream job as a Hollywood tour guide - and the many trials and tribulations he has to overcome just to get to the interview. It's an engaging and often emotional journey as sometimes things just aren't fair. But at its heart it is a comedy full of fun twists and turns.

As the inevitable police intervention is drawing nearer, he is taking greater and greater risks in his attempt to create the ultimate artwork.

The city of Brussels, plagued by high rates of youth unemployment, is home to nearly forty street gangs, and the number of young people drawn into the city's gang culture increases each year. It's in this criminal milieu that directing duo Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah set Black, a pulse-pounding contemporary take on a Shakespearean tragedy. Worlds collide when Mavela (Martha Canga Antonio), a teenage girl with ties to Brussels' Black Bronx gang, meets Marwan (Aboubakr Bensaihi), a member of a rival Moroccan gang, at a police station. Keenly aware of the consequences of getting involved with someone from another gang, they at first resist their attraction to one another, but they can only resist for so long. Just when they've started to imagine a different life for themselves, a terrifying incident reminds Mavela where she belongs - and, more precisely, to whom. In order to break free, Mavela and Marwan will have to betray the very loyalties on which their gangs are founded. And they know what lies ahead for them if they don't. El Arbi and Fallah's film moves forward at an electrifying pace, with furious energy and a gritty realism reminiscent of epic gangster films like City of God and Goodfellas. Ricocheting from moments of extreme tenderness to scenes of extreme violence, and enhanced by the raw performances of its young leads, Black is a full-on, no-holds-barred experience that will resonate long after you've left the cinema.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE0OTIwMjIwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTk0ODUzNzE@._V1_SX300.jpg,N/A,N/A,11 Nov 2015,True,60%,95 min,Black,movie,N/A,"Nele Meirhaeghe, Adil El Arbi, Bilall Fallah",2015,tt4008758,7.0,"4,675",

Jimmie has long wanted to reclaim what he sees as his place in San Francisco, which to him means the house he grew up in and which his same named paternal grandfather built in the post-war era in a style indicative to the area a century earlier.

"Roger Bartley, Howe Cayton, Scott Finnegan",N/A,N/A,United States,N/A,Seth Breedlove,Documentary,5.4/10,English,,N/A,"In August of 1978 a small town in eastern Ohio was thrust into the spotlight when a local family sighted a ""monster"" in the woods behind their home. Over subsequent evenings they were repeatedly visited by the creature culminating in a late-night encounter that ended in local police being called in. The story blasted onto the front pages of newspapers across the state and into the consciousness of a nation. For weeks, police, news crews, and scores of hunters descended on the town of Minerva with one common goal; to find the beast. In the midst of this hurricane of activity stood the Cayton family. Their call to local police spurred a media frenzy that continued for years and brought them unwanted attention and ridicule. In time, their story was forgotten and lost to time. Now, nearly 36 years later, the Minerva Monster will be unveiled once again. Featuring in-depth interviews with law enforcement, media personnel and witnesses, Minerva Monster aims to retell the Cayton's story as it never has been before. Against the backdrop of small-town America a myth will become reality. The documentary film is directed by Seth Breedlove, and produced by Jesse Morgan and Alan Megargle. Minerva Monster is the first in a series of documentaries called Small Town Monsters. Setting aside all the drama, and preamble of previous ""monster"" documentaries, Minerva Monster will tell the story through witness interviews; the real story, in the words of those who lived it.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODM2NzUyNTE5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDk4NjY5NTE@._V1_SX300.jpg,N/A,N/A,16 May 2015,True,,54 min,Minerva Monster,movie,N/A,Seth Breedlove,2015,tt4757986,5.4,139,
