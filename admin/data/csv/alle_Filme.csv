The reason for her absence was among other things to get a Reno divorce, from, of all people, Walter, who admits he was a bad husband. Hildy divorced Walter largely because she wanted more of a home life, whereas Walter saw her more as a driven hard-boiled reporter than subservient homemaker. Hildy has also come to tell Walter that she is taking the afternoon train to Albany, where she will be getting married tomorrow to staid straight-laced insurance agent, Bruce Baldwin, with whose mother they will live, at least for the first year. Walter doesn't want to lose Hildy, either as a reporter or a wife, and if he does, doesn't believe Bruce is worthy of her. Walter does whatever he can at least to delay Hildy and Bruce's trip, long enough to persuade Hildy to stay for good. His plan includes doing whatever he can to place Bruce in a bad light, while dangling a big story under her nose, namely covering what the newspaper believes is the unfair imminent execution of convicted cop killer, Earl Williams. Hildy doesn't trust Walter in dealing with her and Bruce in an above board manner, but the lure of what potentially may become the biggest story in years, which includes true love, a bumbling sheriff and a corrupt mayor, the latter's actions largely in light of an upcoming election, may prove to be too much for Hildy to resist, especially if it ends up being an exclusive.

My wish for Christmas is that they would leave education to the schools and entertainment to us."" The United States was in the middle of a struggle for civil rights for Blacks, and here the lesson offered to small children was to be content with one's lot in life.

In olden times, a barbaric king often used the façade of being genial to lull his enemies into a false sense of security. If there was a criminal case that caught his fancy, he would bring the accused into an amphitheater which had two closed doors side by side, one of which he was to open. Behind one door would be a tiger which would maul him to death. Behind the other would be a lady suitable for marriage. Regardless of the accused's past or current situation, a funeral or wedding would then take place depending on which door he opened. The King loved his daughter, who was as cold hearted as him.

Divorced for ten years, he lives alone on the southern California coast with his pet dog in the same run down shack in which he has lived for twenty-five years, the shack which his father passed down to him. In the intervening years, ostentatious houses have sprung up around him. He's been at the same architectural firm for twenty years in a job he hates, which primarily consists of building scale models. On the day that he is fired from his job, he is diagnosed with an advanced case of terminal cancer, which he chooses not to disclose to his family. In many ways, this day is the happiest of his recent life in that he decides to spend what little time he has left doing what he really wants to do, namely build a house he can call his own to replace the shack. He also wants his rebellious sixteen-year-old son, Sam Monroe (Hayden Christensen), to live with him for the summer, hopefully not only to help in the house construction, but for the two to reconnect as a family. Getting Sam to do any of it will not be an easy task as Sam, who has embarked on some self-destructive behavior, would rather do anything than spend time with his family, which also includes his mother Robin Kimball (Dame Kristin Scott Thomas), her wealthy but emotionally unaffectionate husband Peter Kimball (Jamey Sheridan), and their adolescent children. In Sam, George sees an unhappy person in every aspect of his life, much like George was before that fateful day. What Sam decides to do for the summer may consider Alyssa Beck (Jena Malone), his pretty classmate and George's next door neighbor.

Sharon is afraid that Fred will be killed by gambler Joe Sapphire, to whom he has amassed a large debt. Sharon also confides that she is in love with her husband's business partner, Stephen Mason, and that she wants to keep her husband alive so that Stephen will not be suspected if Fred is murdered by Sapphire. When Jerry asks Sapphire to call off his hit on Fred, Sapphire tells Jerry that Fred has paid him in full, and that the money was the exact amount reported stolen from the Tiger Club's safe a week earlier. A short time later, Sharon and Stephen find the dead body of her husband, along with a suicide note instructing Sharon to collect Fred's life insurance money. While Sharon unthinkingly touches a gun on Fred's desk, Stephen burns the note so that the suicide clause on Fred's insurance will not invalidate Sharon's claim. Suspicion soon falls on Sapphire, who later accuses Jerry of setting him up. At the coroner's inquest, Inspector Henry Leggett testifies that Fred was shot at close range, and Mr. White, a representative from the insurance company, suggests that Fred killed himself. Rosie Gargan, a cleaning woman at Fred's office, then testifies that she saw a woman enter Fred's office around the time of the murder.

He is a cowboy as raw as his hides. The year is 1925. The Burbank brothers are wealthy ranchers in Montana. At the Red Mill restaurant on their way to market, the brothers meet Rose, the widowed proprietress, and her impressionable son Peter. Phil behaves so cruelly he drives them both to tears, revelling in their hurt and rousing his fellow cowhands to laughter - all except his brother George, who comforts Rose then returns to marry her. As Phil swings between fury and cunning, his taunting of Rose takes an eerie form - he hovers at the edges of her vision, whistling a tune she can no longer play. His mockery of her son is more overt, amplified by the cheering of Phil's cowhand disciples. Then Phil appears to take the boy under his wing. Is this latest gesture a softening that leaves Phil exposed, or a plot twisting further into menace?",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzgyMzA2NDEtZWUxNy00MDNmLTllMDYtNzZmNTU5ZWVmMzhlXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg,N/A,R,01 Dec 2021,True,94%,126 min,The Power of the Dog,movie,N/A,"Jane Campion, Thomas Savage",2021,tt10293406,6.8,"198,809",

To protect himself from this scourge - Chang, son of a Shopping Mall owner, employs two female Martial Arts experts to protect himself and his family.That is the set-up!
