Fantomas: The Man in Black,1913,Not Rated,01 Nov 1913,61 min,"Crime, Drama",Louis Feuillade,"Marcel Allain, Louis Feuillade, Pierre Souvestre","René Navarre, Edmund Breon, Georges Melchior","Naturally, after his last experience, Inspector Juve winces under such rebuff as the substitution of Valgrand and the escape of Fantomas. Eventually a mysterious crime puzzles him and his assistant, Fandor. To the chief of the Criminal Investigation Department, he reports that the body of a woman, found in the house of Dr. Charles, cannot be identified. Papers bearing the name of Lady Beltham had been discovered in her clothing. Was the body that of Lady Beltham, the accomplice of Gurn, or was it the intention that people should believe that she was dead? Juve wondered why the body was found in the house of Dr. Charles. He concerns himself to watch the house, and the patience of Fandor and himself is unexpectedly rewarded. One day Dr. Charles leaves the house, and the car in which he rides is followed. Charles makes a false move. The man who leaves the closed car is not the Dr. Charles who got in. He is now a young man, with a black moustache, whereas Charles is a middle-aged man with a black beard. That is decidedly suspicions, and the detectives are in time to see him accept a note from a woman who is waiting for him. Instructing Fandor to follow the girl, Juve goes after the other man, known to the police as Lawrence, the leader of bandits. Following Lawrence (alias Charles) in a taxi, he is fated to lose his quarry, as an accomplice of the bandit punctures the tire of one of the wheels, and Juve is stranded in a street while Lawrence gets clear away. So far there is nothing to connect Charles, alias Lawrence, with Fantomas, alias Gurn. Fandor fares much better. The girl does not succeed in throwing the younger detective off the track and is apparently unconscious of the fact that she is being followed until she notices Fandor in the same compartment of the railway carriage in which she is traveling. Fandor tracks her to a house. Having seen her safely indoors, he sends a note to Juve, saying that he is keeping a good watch. Meanwhile, Lawrence has rend the note Josephine handed him, and he learns that an elderly man, confidential clerk in the employment of Messrs, Brown and Co., has fallen in love with her. That afternoon he is taking $30,000 to clients of the firm, and thinking that she is attached to him, wishes to take her with him on the journey. They were leaving the Gare de Lyon Station for Bercy by the Northern Express at three o'clock that afternoon. Would Lawrence be at the station with others of the gang? In consequence of the breakdown of the car, the note which Fandor had written did not reach Juve. Fandor, however, had waited near the house of the girl, and when she left, dressed as a lady, followed her to the Gare de Lyon, where she met the confidential messenger. No doubt there was a hidden meaning in this meeting, and Fandor decided to join the train; so did Lawrence and others of the gang whom he had gathered round him. The whole party traveled in the last coach of the train, and when the time bad arrived, one of the men climbed along the footboard and uncoupled the coach. Lawrence recognized Fandor, but his presence on the train made no difference to the plans of the bandits. As the coach began to fall away from the rest of the train, Josephine left the compartment in which a peremptory demand for the money be carried, whilst Fandor was also attacked. By this time the speed of the coach has very sensibly slackened and the gang easily escaped, fleeing in a motorcar waiting for them. In the car they examined the haul, and to their intense mortification discovered that the notes the man carried were all half notes, the remainder of which were to be handed to the clients of Brown and Co. when the contract was completed. When Fandor recovered from the shock of the attack he pulled the communication cord. To his consternation he found that not only had it been severed, but that the coach was running down the decline. He knew that the Northern Express was following the train in which he had traveled, and nothing but a miracle would avert a serious disaster. The coach ran back, and as the express began to cross the bridge the engine collided with the coach and the whole train was terribly wrecked. Lawrence determines to obtain the remaining halves of the notes, but decides that before doing so Juve must be killed. With that purpose in view, he, in the name of Fandor, wires to Juve to come to the Bercy cellars of Brown and Co. the following night. Juve, taking the wire as authentic, goes to Bercy, and. seeing someone moving behind the casks, fires, and then creeps forward, to run against Fandor. Lawrence and his accomplice began firing at the detectives, the barrels of spirit were set on fire, and through a tornado of flames the detectives escape. Fantomas again himself escapes, and they lose entire trace of him until one night when at a hotel, Juve and Fandor meet Josephine, and after Juve is introduced by Fandor, he insists that Josephine divulge the whereabouts of Fantomas. She reluctantly, under the threat of arrest, takes Juve to a place where Fantomas is dining with two wealthy young ladies in the disguise of the supposed Dr. Charles. A card is sent to Fantomas saying that someone is waiting for him outside. Fantomas, believing this to be one of his gang, departs from the hotel and is immediately arrested by Juve and Fandor. After they walk down the street, Dr. Charles suddenly makes a struggle and to the amazement of Juve and Fandor, he leaves in their hands nothing but two plaster casts of his arms with his coat sleeves attached. They decide to track Lady Beltham. After much trouble they discover her to be making midnight visits to her old haunted villa. Here they make a visit in the day-time, and being satisfied that there must be still some connection between Fantomas and Lady Beltham, hide and overhear a conversation where Faniomas decides be must get rid of Juve and will send a silent executioner to destroy him. Juve does not exactly know what this silent executioner means, but he prepares to receive a serpent. He is almost crushed to death in spite of his precaution, but survives and surrounds the haunted villa of Lady Beltham. Fantomas is almost caught unprepared, but being ever ready, he quickly sets a trap in which to get together the whole of the police, including Juve and Fandor, so that he may destroy them all by dynamite. These easily fall into the trap, so quickly but well laid. Fantomas realizes that his opportunity has come, and leaping from a cistern in which he had been hiding, he touches the coil of wire and explodes the dynamite cartridge, blowing the haunted villa to a heap of ruins, together with the occupants. The question still remains unsolved: Are Juve and Fandor still alive?","None, French",France,1 nomination,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTFkM2M4MTAtMTE2NC00MjZlLThlZDctMWU3YTIwY2ViMzU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDI3OTIzOA@@._V1_SX300.jpg,"[{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '6.9/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '100%'}]",N/A,6.9,"1,676",tt0003037,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,,N/A,True

The reason for her absence was among other things to get a Reno divorce, from, of all people, Walter, who admits he was a bad husband. Hildy divorced Walter largely because she wanted more of a home life, whereas Walter saw her more as a driven hard-boiled reporter than subservient homemaker. Hildy has also come to tell Walter that she is taking the afternoon train to Albany, where she will be getting married tomorrow to staid straight-laced insurance agent, Bruce Baldwin, with whose mother they will live, at least for the first year. Walter doesn't want to lose Hildy, either as a reporter or a wife, and if he does, doesn't believe Bruce is worthy of her. Walter does whatever he can at least to delay Hildy and Bruce's trip, long enough to persuade Hildy to stay for good. His plan includes doing whatever he can to place Bruce in a bad light, while dangling a big story under her nose, namely covering what the newspaper believes is the unfair imminent execution of convicted cop killer, Earl Williams. Hildy doesn't trust Walter in dealing with her and Bruce in an above board manner, but the lure of what potentially may become the biggest story in years, which includes true love, a bumbling sheriff and a corrupt mayor, the latter's actions largely in light of an upcoming election, may prove to be too much for Hildy to resist, especially if it ends up being an exclusive.

Robert Alden, Mr. Hanson (of the Hanson lumber mill), and the well-to-do Olesons, owners of the local mercantile, and also the primary rivals of the Ingalls family (except the Oleson patriarch).

While the rest of the animation industry was nearing its trough, with no money to spend and the only source of income ill-paying TV, this one has all of its technical issues sorted away: full animation, very good backgrounding and an engaging jazz score. With all this, what are we offered? A story for small children in which we are told to be content with what we are, because that is what we are meant to be.It reminds me of something Joseph Barbera said in the late 1970s, that he yearned for a return to animation in which ""when a cat chases a mouse, he doesn't have to stop and teach him how to blow glass or weave a basket. My wish for Christmas is that they would leave education to the schools and entertainment to us."" The United States was in the middle of a struggle for civil rights for Blacks, and here the lesson offered to small children was to be content with one's lot in life.

Sharon is afraid that Fred will be killed by gambler Joe Sapphire, to whom he has amassed a large debt. Sharon also confides that she is in love with her husband's business partner, Stephen Mason, and that she wants to keep her husband alive so that Stephen will not be suspected if Fred is murdered by Sapphire. When Jerry asks Sapphire to call off his hit on Fred, Sapphire tells Jerry that Fred has paid him in full, and that the money was the exact amount reported stolen from the Tiger Club's safe a week earlier. A short time later, Sharon and Stephen find the dead body of her husband, along with a suicide note instructing Sharon to collect Fred's life insurance money. While Sharon unthinkingly touches a gun on Fred's desk, Stephen burns the note so that the suicide clause on Fred's insurance will not invalidate Sharon's claim. Suspicion soon falls on Sapphire, who later accuses Jerry of setting him up. At the coroner's inquest, Inspector Henry Leggett testifies that Fred was shot at close range, and Mr. White, a representative from the insurance company, suggests that Fred killed himself. Rosie Gargan, a cleaning woman at Fred's office, then testifies that she saw a woman enter Fred's office around the time of the murder. The jury rules the death a murder, and Sharon receives a check for $100,000 from the insurance company. Jerry grows increasingly suspicious of Sharon, however, and decides to pressure Stephen into confessing. Jerry's persistence wears on Stephen, until Sharon, who is actually the murderer, realizes that she is in danger of being exposed. Luring Stephen up to Fred's office, Sharon pushes him out of the window and he falls to his death. The police believe that Stephen killed himself out of remorse for murdering Fred, but Jerry is even more convinced of Sharon's guilt, and in order to prove it, begins courting her. Jerry persuades Sharon to accompany him on a trip, but during the train ride, Sharon realizes that Jerry is only seeking evidence to convict her. Aiming a gun at him, Sharon confesses to Jerry that his suspicions about her are correct.
